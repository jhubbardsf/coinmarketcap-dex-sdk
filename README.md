# CoinMarketCap DEX SDK

## Description

This is a unofficial SDK for the [DEX
API](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/dex-apis-soft-launch-unveiling-coinmarketcaps-first-dex-api-suite)
on CoinMarketCap. Most of this is being ported from an exported [Postman
Collection
(Official)](https://www.postman.com/bryancmc/workspace/coinmarketcap-dex-apis/collection/27765301-3b01b3d6-9934-4e39-b770-92536a0932bd?action=share&creator=27765301).

This is a personal project I'm using and figured it might be helpful to others,
I'll update it and keep it maintained as I use it. Feel free to chip in.

The goal is to make the API type safe and easier to use. Current SDK is lightweight with 0 dependencies.

Several of the endpoints are not yet implemented, but I'll be adding them
if/when I need them. Otherwise feel free to PR.

## Installation

```bash
npm install coinmarketcap-dex-sdk
